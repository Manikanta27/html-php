       <h3><p><b2> Amit says,</b2> <br>Visited as a guest in the Echo restaurant for lunch just today. We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning ðŸ˜Š. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, Jackie. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos! <p></h3></div>

       <h3><p><b2>Thomas Says,</b2><br>Hello. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful room and bottle of sparkling wine for our Anniversary stay. We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular (we ate two meals there). Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to staying with you in the future. What a great place! </p> </h3></div>

       <h3>  <b2>Biba says</b2>,<br>Spent 3 nights at this resort earlier this month and it was a great stay! We paid for an upgrade to the oceanfront cabana, which was worth the price. The beach views, calm ocean and ability to watch the sunset on our patio were highlights of the trip! The hotel restaurant was exceptional, not only because every meal we enjoyed had a variety of options and was flavorful but also because the prices were so reasonable for an oceanfront resort! The entire island and resort were a lot more laid back and calm than other touristy coastal front towns in the southeast, but that may in part due to it being early March. I'd imagine there's a bit more traffic during high seasons, but either way, we'll definitely be back! Highly recommended!</h3></div>
